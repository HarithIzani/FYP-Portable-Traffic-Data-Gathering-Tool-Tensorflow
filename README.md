# FYP-Portable-Traffic-Data-Gathering-Tool-Tensorflow
Using Tensorflow, Transfer Learning as well as other tools and techniques to create a 2 models in a framework specialised in detecting objects for all environmental conditions. The project also uses a Raspberry Pi to make the system portable.

NOTE: For BOTH experimental build and raspberry pi build, remember to CHANGE the pathing to the correct models.
NOTE: Network IP address must be changed before use, if not just comment the line and it still would function, just wont send the file over local network.
